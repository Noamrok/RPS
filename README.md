# RPS
A remake for the old ICQ PC game called "Rock-Paper-Scissors".

My friends and I developed this multiplyer game for android, we had a course in Software Engineering and it was our project.

The game was developed in Unity- C#.

The backend was developed with ASP .NET EF and Web API, using SQL as DB. We uploaded the Web API and DB to Azure DevOps for cloud.

Here are some Images from the game:
